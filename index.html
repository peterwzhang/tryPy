                    <h4>Moving Forward</h4>
                    <p>As this implementation of tryPy is quite rudimentary, we have many goals for the language moving
                        forward. We aim to improve the user experience of tryPy in addition to the functionality of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of the user experience/quality of life improvements we would like to implement in the
                        future
                        include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A customizable user interface that would allow users to have a layout that works best for
                            them,
                            some of these customizations include: customizable font, font size, block size, and the
                            positioning of starting blocks
                        </li>
                        <li>Changes to the user interface that would make tryPy more visually appealing, especially to
                            children</li>
                        <li>Copy and pasting blocks</li>
                        <li>A way to save, load, and share projects</li>
                        <li>Color blind modes</li>
                        <li>Optimizations to rendering to improve battery usage while using tryPy</li>
                        <li>Allowing the snap ranges of blocks to be changed based on the user's liking</li>
                        <li>Snapping sound effect for when blocks are snapped</li>
                    </ul>

                        Some of the functional improvements and functionality we would like to implement in the future
                        include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allowing tryPy to better handle strings and string manipulation (blocks for string methods)
                        </li>
                        <li>Allowing tryPy to better handle lists (blocks for list methods)</li>
                        <li>Adding blocks for function which in turn allows recursion and other functional features of
                            the
                            language</li>
                        <li>Overall growth in complexity of what tryPy can handle</li>
                        <li>An instructional guide appearing on start with an option to participate in a walkthrough
                            tutorial showing the features of tryPy</li>
                        <li>Two modes: one where there are various challenges and you must complete one challenge to

                <p>Our goal for this language is simple: create an accessible, visually based language that can be
                    easily used by
                    elementary and early middle school students while displaying more of the actual syntax of a typed
                    programming
                    language (in our case, Python). Most block coding languages, like Scratch, have more simplistic
                    syntax on the
                    blocks, writing commands in English rather than allowing the student to see the language behind the
                    blocks. These
                    traditional block coding languages certainly have merit. They are a great way to get students
                    excited about the field
                    of computer science and introduce the problem-solving skills that are important to programming.
                    However, the jump
                    from block coding to typing code can be quite jarring. The intent of tryPy is to provide a more
                    student-oriented
                    transition to typing code by combining the easy-to-conceptualize blocks with typed Python.
                </p>
                <p>We chose Python as the language for our intermediate blocks due to its wide usage and simple syntax.
                    Since the
                    code will appear in blocks, it makes the most sense to first implement intermediate block coding
                    using a language
                    with an easier-to-visualize syntax than other languages like C. Additionally, since Python is so
                    widely used, it is a
                    skill that will be applicable in a variety of fields. Students will receive exposure to Python from
                    a young age which
                    will improve fluency later in life. Like with any spoken language, it is easier to learn a language
                    if you begin
                    young and tryPy is a great way to introduce Python early.
                </p>
                <p>To gather more information about the potential utility of such a language, we interviewed an
                    elementary school
                    teacher, who will be referred to as Mrs. C. Mrs. C uses block coding to introduce computer science
                    concepts to her
                    students and participates in Hour of Code with third, fourth, and fifth graders each year. In our
                    interview, we asked
                    questions regarding the utility of block coding as it is being used in the classroom now, the
                    usefulness of
                    introducing computer science concepts to students at a young age, and the potential utility of an
                    intermediate block
                    language such as tryPy.
                </p>
                <p>Our first questions to Mrs. C were regarding block coding as it is currently implemented. Mrs. C uses
                    Hour of Code
                    to reach students outside of her own classroom, so to share insight on the largest sample size, many
                    of her responses
                    were surrounding Hour of Code over the past 3 years. Mrs. C primarily focused on two activities with
                    students during
                    Hour of Code. Of the two activities, one was geared toward the younger students (third and fourth
                    graders) and the
                    other was geared toward the older students (fourth graders with previous coding experience and fifth
                    graders). Mrs. C
                    noted that between the two activities, despite being in the same block language, there were certain
                    differences in
                    how you need to connect blocks to complete the tasks. She said this caused some confusion in
                    students who had done
                    both options. Other than the difference in the syntax in the two activities, Mrs. C thought the
                    blocks were a great
                    way to introduce programming to the students. There was an option to see the code behind what the
                    blocks were doing,
                    which was too great of a jump from the blocks for students to fully understand what the code did but
                    was interesting
                    feedback on current implementation of blocks.
                </p>
                <p>Our next questions to Mrs. C were regarding block coding and the introduction of computer science
                    concepts to
                    young students. In her opinion, block coding is a good introduction to computer science and has
                    certainly inspired
                    an increased interest in computer science within her students. She even mentioned that some teachers
                    now use block
                    coding projects as a reward for students if they complete other classwork early since the students
                    enjoy it so much.
                    When asked about the skills that block coding has helped her students, learn, Mrs. C said that
                    outside of computer
                    and coding skills, participating in Hour of Code and otherwise using block coding has helped teach
                    her students about
                    perseverance and the importance of trying different solutions to solving a problem. She also noted
                    that it helps
                    students learn about problem solving skills that apply to other fields academically and outside of
                    the classroom.
                </p>
                <p>We closed out our interview with Ms. C by asking about the utility of an intermediate block
                    programming language.
                    We explained the concept of tryPy and its visualization of code that is syntactically similar to
                    Python. She was
                    interested in the concept and agreed that it would be most useful as a “half-step” from pure block
                    coding to fully
                    typed coding. She said that from her experience, students should still start out with a pure block
                    language, like
                    Scratch, and then move into an intermediate block language such as tryPy in fifth grade (if they
                    have sufficient block
                    coding experience) or middle school. With the increased realism of tryPy, students would be able to
                    more
                    easily transition from blocks to typing, and the retention of interest between elementary, middle,
                    and high
                    school would increase.
                </p>
                <p>Our new language, tryPy has the potential to revolutionize the way computer science is taught to
                    young students.
                    It would bridge the gap between purely block coding and purely typed coding, making the transition
                    smoother for
                    students who start working with blocks and maintaining students’ interest in computer science
                    throughout their
                    elementary and middle school years. Through an interview with a teacher who currently uses block
                    coding in her
                    classroom, we have verified these ideas from an educator’s point of view. tryPy increases the
                    accessibility of
                    computer science to students in elementary school while also maintaining interest in computer
                    science as students
                    continue with their education.

                    <h4>Implementation</h4>
                    <p>
                        To implement this code we first created our blocks. We made a base block class which has all the
                        base properties of a block, such as dimensions, color, rendering method, and movement. Then all
                        of
                        our other blocks inherit from the base block and have their own additional properties and
                        methods as
                        needed. In order to handle the actual interpreting of blocks, we made a block manager. This
                        class
                        handles all of the tracking of blocks, how they snap together, and also interprets the block
                        code. In order to interpret the code the block manager keeps track of every block connected to
                        the start block. When the "s" key is pressed the block manager will tokenize the blocks into a
                        string of python code then creates a code object using that string. The code object is then
                        executed and the result is printed to the console. When the "r" key is pressed, all blocks
                        are reset to the original selection menu.

                    </p>

                <h4>Using tryPy</h4>
                <p>Once you have a tryPy window open and running, the world is your oyster! To use tryPy, you MUST start with a "start"
                    block. This is what tells the interpreter where to look for code. To add code, simply drag blocks from the selection menu
                    and connect them to each other.
                </p><p>
                    To connect blocks, bring the block to the middle of the block you want to connect it to. In loops and conditional
                    statements, to add blocks outside of the loop or condition, bring the block to the left of the block you want to
                    connect it to. If you want to add text to a block, make sure you add it BEFORE you connect it to another block.
                </p><p>
                    To run your tryPy code, click out of any text box you may be in and hit the "s" key. This will run your code and output it
                    to the terminal. Did you make a mistake and want to restart? No worries! Just hit the "r" key (as long as you're
                    out of any text box) and all of your blocks will be reset! Do you want to see the Python equivalent of your tryPy code?
                    Just press "p" and the Python code will output to the terminal!
                </p><p>

                        the basic
